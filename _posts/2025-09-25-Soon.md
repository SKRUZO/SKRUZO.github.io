I’d originally intended to try and create some eloquent and thorough write up about how I’ve struggled with finishing projects for a long time, and how, while I don’t have the answer or fix, I’m trying out a few things to work on that. This blog is one of those things, and I wanted my first post to perfectly explain the issue as I saw it and explain my plan going forward…

It’s almost been a week and I keep putting off writing it because I just couldn’t find the perfect words. I didn’t explain the problem, I encapsulated it in my very first post, or lack thereof. 

Instead, let’s do this! Let’s just begin!

Hi, I’m SKRUZO (stylized all uppercase). I’m from the Pacific Northwest, I love technology, nature, and I struggle with finishing projects because I feel like they have to be perfect. This blog is my attempt to aim for “done” rather than “perfect” because the latter just hasn’t been working for me.

I plan to document the things that I work on, whatever they may be, and muse about things that interest me here. If anything I write is interesting or helpful to someone in the future, then all the better and I’m glad! If this resource only serves as a tool for me to work on some personal crippling perfectionism, then it will have served its purpose!

Here’s to finishing some projects!
